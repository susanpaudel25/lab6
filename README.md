# Issues
- After registration, the user need to login before they are able to submit any data. It doesnot directly go to the data submission page.
- No confident about how to characterize dangerous, offensive or normal.
- The csv file is returned in the downloaded version in data, probably not the link format asked in the question.
- Other parts completed.
